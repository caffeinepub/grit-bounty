# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Set English as the default language for all UI content throughout the application.

**Planned changes:**
- Change default language initialization to English in the language management logic
- Update language detection to prioritize English over browser language preferences
- Ensure language selection screen defaults to English as pre-selected option
- Keep language switcher functionality intact for manual language changes

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see all application interfaces in English by default on first visit, including the login screen, splash screen, and all navigation elements. The language can still be manually switched to Chinese if desired.
