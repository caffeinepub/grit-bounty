# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix language switching so the entire application interface updates immediately when a user selects a new language.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix the language switching mechanism to trigger immediate UI updates across all components when a language is selected from the dropdown
- Ensure language changes persist across page refreshes
- Verify all components (SplashScreen, MainApp, BountyBoard, LaunchMission, PersonalCenter, QuestCard, etc.) properly respond to language changes

**User-visible outcome:** When users select a language from the dropdown, all text throughout the application immediately updates to the chosen language without requiring a manual page refresh.
