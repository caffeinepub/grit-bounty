# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add an introduction page accessible from the splash screen that explains Grit Bounty's concept, rules, bounty mechanism, settlement process, and warrior credit system.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a semi-transparent "How it works? (运作规则)" link below the ENTER button on the splash screen
- Create an introduction modal component with scrollable content displaying five main sections: Core Mission, Use Cases, Bounty Mechanism, Settlement Rules, and Warrior Credit System
- Add complete translation keys for all introduction content in English, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese
- Style the modal consistently with existing dark theme dialog patterns

**User-visible outcome:** Users can click the "How it works?" link on the splash screen to read a comprehensive explanation of the Grit Bounty platform, including how tasks are published with ICP deposits, how warriors can accept quests, settlement rules with platform fees, and the credit reduction system for successful warriors.
