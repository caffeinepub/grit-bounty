  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all three requirements. REQ-1 (Cancel Quest button functionality) and REQ-2 (Delete button functionality) are fully implemented with proper dialog state management in PersonalCenter.tsx. REQ-3 (visual feedback during processing) is implemented in both CancelQuestDialog.tsx and DeleteQuestDialog.tsx with loading states and disabled buttons during mutations. Additional related dialogs (AbandonQuestDialog, ExitQuestDialog) were also enhanced with similar patterns, though these were not requested.",
