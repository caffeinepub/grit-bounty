  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses REQ-1 by converting the language management to a React Context pattern with LanguageProvider wrapping the entire application at the root level. This ensures all components can access and react to language changes immediately. The useLanguage hook was modified to use React Context instead of local state, enabling global state management. Key changes include: App.tsx wraps everything with LanguageProvider, LanguageSwitcher updates the global language state via setLanguage, and MainApp uses the translation function for tab labels. The localStorage persistence was preserved as required. All modified files are directly related to the language switching mechanism as per the constraints.",
