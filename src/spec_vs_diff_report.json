REQ-3 requires language codes 'en', 'zh-CN', 'zh-TW' but the implementation uses 'English', 'SimplifiedChinese', 'TraditionalChinese'. REQ-1 and REQ-2 are correctly implemented with only 3 language options. REQ-4 appears implemented (translations.ts shows 3 languages) though the file is truncated.",
