  "summary": "The diff implements foundational user profile management with credit score and deposit tracking in the backend, plus frontend UI components for deposit confirmation, dispute voting, and appeal submission. However, critical backend logic is missing: no ICP Ledger integration, no quest data model, no automated reward distribution, no dispute resolution system, and no state machine. Most frontend components are placeholders awaiting backend implementation.",
